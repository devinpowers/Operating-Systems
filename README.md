# Operating-Systems


* Using MIT XV6 for Projects and learning
___

XV6 booted on my mac [x]


[Heres the link to download the book on XV6 from MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf)

To compile and start the Operating System 

```bash
make qemu
```
This will open the OS in a different terminal





If you want to open the OS in the current terminal then run this:

```bash
make qemu-nox 
```


## Intro to XV6

* If you run **ls** there will return about 2 dozen files
