# Chapter 3: Process

* New thing

A Process is an instance of a program in execution 

**Virtualization** is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware.


In computing, virtualization is the act of *creating a virtual* (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.


What is the **Kernal?**

This middle layer is referred to as the kernel. Basically the kernel virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its own virtual resources. This makes the process seem as it is the sole process running on the machine. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes.
